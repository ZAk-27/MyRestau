# MyRestau

MyRestau is a restaurant management web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, bundled with Vite.

This project leverages several cutting-edge technologies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application and will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling. It provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite features an extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and true on-demand compilation.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It allows for a highly customizable configuration and comes with many utilities and components out-of-the-box.

- **React Icons**: This library includes a collection of popular icon sets that can be easily imported and used in a React application. It allows for easier use of icons in your app without having to worry about importing SVGs or other image files.

- **useState Hook**: This is a built-in hook in React that lets you add React state to function components. In this project, it's used to handle user interactions and update components in response to these interactions.
